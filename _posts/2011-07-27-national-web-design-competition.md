I competed in the WorldSkills web design national final in 2010 and 2011. This
would initially start as an internal competition in colleges, with the best website
of each course level submitted to WorldSkills for selection in the national final.

In 2010, we had to compete in a barricaded arena in a Milton Keynes shopping mall, with the public walking around and
talking.
And the in 2011, the competition took place within Highbury College. The competition required a website to be
constructed in around eight hours,
including: documentation (site-maps, storyboards, page descriptions), Adobe Flash animations (with actionscript) and a
website
(with JavaScript, CSS and HTML conforming to XHTML 1.0 strict standards).

On my first attempt, in 2010, I came joint-third and received bronze. And then in 2011, I came first and received gold,
with the website
using PHP (as opposed to a static site the first time). I developed all of the CSS, JS, PHP and HTML in Notepad++, which
had only
syntax-highlighting (no auto-completion). I suspect this impressed the judges, especially since I finished around an
hour or two early. We also
had no access to internet for resources, so the development took place within a very limited amount of time, using
purely what we had learned.
The PHP was also not a requirement for my level, but I used it to have a global site layout, to make my life easier and
reduce repetition.
