A 2D WebGL multi-player engine and game, using websockets, with: basic AI, inventories, large open worlds, tile worlds,
player-persistence, map-editor and more.

This project was about solving various challenges, and was never intended to produce a playable game unfortunately!


# Features
- Separating axis theorem (SAT) for collision detection, and minimum translation vector (MTV) for response.
- Inventory system, with weapons and actions.
- Stats system, leaderboard, etc.
- Bullet collisions.
