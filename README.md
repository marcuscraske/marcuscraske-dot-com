This repository hosts the source code behind my personal website:

<https://marcuscraske.com>

Notable directories:
- *asset-sources* - the source files behind assets
- *deployment* - configuration for deploying the website.


## Jekyll
This is a simple Jekyll website, thus refer to the
[official docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

### Prerequisites
Linux:

````
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev
````

Linux/MacOS:
````
sudo gem install bundler jekyll
````

Run from current directory:

````
bundle install
````

Install Node package manager, as per official instructions.

And with a terminal in this directory:
````
npm install
````

This will pull down a few third-party modules.
